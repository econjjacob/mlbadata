Note:  TranStats reports both variables with missing data, and their derived
counterparts with imputed values filled in, denoted by an "I" at the end.
Only one variant (the original or the derived) is included here. An "R" at the
end of the variable name indicates that the Transtats variable has been
collapsed into fewer categories for analysis purposes.

\description{
These data, from the U.S. Bureau of Transportation Statistics, can be used to predict
whether an accident will results in injuries or fatalities, based on  predictors
such as alcohol involvement, time of day, road condition, etc.  Such a prediction
system could be used to prioritize responder resources at the time of the report.
